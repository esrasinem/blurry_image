# blurry_image

In this project, I built a blurry loading image page. When the webpage is refreshed, the original image appears blurred. An initial percentage of "0%" is displayed, and this value increases towards 100% as the image comes into focus. 

I created a blur effect on the image, and I mapped different number ranges to the 0-100 load ( the image blur goes from 30 pixels as it starts and it decreases to 0, as the image loads from 0% to 100%).
